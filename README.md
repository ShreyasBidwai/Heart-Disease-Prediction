# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This project is designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease using a logistic regression model. It utilizes a dataset with 15 independent features (parameters) and 1 target label indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

# Overview

- **Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (for interactive web-based user interface)
- **Model Persistence**: Joblib (to save and load the trained model)
- **Dataset**: Includes 15 independent parameters and 1 dependent (target) parameter
- **Goal**: Predict whether a patient has heart disease based on input parameters

# Features

- Input form for user to enter 15 health-related parameters
- Logistic regression model trained on medical dataset
- Real-time prediction result display on the Streamlit web interface
- Model saved and loaded using `joblib` for efficiency
